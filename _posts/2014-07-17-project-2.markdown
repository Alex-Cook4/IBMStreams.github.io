description: Healthcare worldwide is in crisis - high costs, poor or inconsistent quality, and inaccessibility are potentially catastrophic. While there is no limit to the amount of data continuously being generated in provider organizations, some lack a way to analyze and correlate the data in real time. IBM Stream Computing enables predictive analytics of data in motion for real-time decisions allowing healthcare providers to capture and analyze data - all the time, just in time. The end goal is to save lives, shorten hospital stays and build healthier communities revolving around preventative care.
